--------------------------Python If ... Else--------------------
Python Conditions and If statements
Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

Equals: a == b
Not Equals: a != b
Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b
These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.
If statement:
a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")

Elif statement:
The elif keyword is Python's way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".

Example
a = 33
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")

Else statment:
The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.

Example
a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
else:
  print("a is greater than b")


-------------------Python Loops------------------------
Python has two primitive loop commands:

while loops
for loops

---------------The while Loop------------
With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

Example
Print i as long as i is less than 6:

i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1

The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready, in this example we need to define an indexing variable, i, which we set to 1.

-----------------------------The break Statement----------------------------
With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:

Example
Exit the loop when i is 3:

i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  if i == 3:
    break
  i += 1

-------------------------The continue Statement----------------------
With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next:

Example
Continue to the next iteration if i is 3:

i = 0
while i < 6:
  i += 1
  if i == 3:
    continue
  print(i)

------------------For Loops------------------
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.

With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

ExampleGet your own Python Server
Print each fruit in a fruit list:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)

Looping Through a String
Even strings are iterable objects, they contain a sequence of characters:

Example
Loop through the letters in the word "banana":

for x in "banana":
  print(x)

The range() Function
To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the range() function,
The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.

Example
Using the range() function:

for x in range(6):
  print(x)

--------------------Nested Loops------------------
A nested loop is a loop inside a loop.

The "inner loop" will be executed one time for each iteration of the "outer loop":

Example
Print each adjective for every fruit:

adj = ["red", "big", "tasty"]
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for x in adj:
  for y in fruits:
    print(x, y)
