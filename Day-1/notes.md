****************What is Python?****************

Python is simple & easy
Free & Open Source
High Level Language
Developed by Guido van Rossum
Portable

*******************Our First Program************************
print("Hello World")

*******************Python Character Set************************
Letters – A to Z, a to z
Digits – 0 to 9
Special Symbols - + - * / etc.
Whitespaces – Blank Space, tab, carriage return, newline, formfeed
Other characters – Python can process all ASCII and Unicode characters as part of data or literals

************Variables************
name = "Shradha"
age = 23
price = 25.99

A variable is a name given to a memory location in a program.
Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

****************Data Types****************************
Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:
Text Type:	str
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	dict
Set Types:	set, frozenset
Boolean Type:	bool
Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
None Type:	NoneType

*********************Python Numbers*******************************
There are three numeric types in Python:
int
float
complex
Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:
Example
x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
z = 1j   # complex


*******************Python Strings***********************
Strings
Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

'hello' is the same as "hello".

You can display a string literal with the print() function:

Example
print("Hello")
print('Hello')

******************************Python Operators******************************
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

Python divides the operators in the following groups:

Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Identity operators
Membership operators
Bitwise operators

Python Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:

Operator	Name	               Example	
+	        Addition	           x + y	
-	        Subtraction	           x - y	
*	        Multiplication	       x * y	
/         	Division	           x / y	
%	        Modulus	               x % y	
**	        Exponentiation	       x ** y	
//	        Floor division	       x // y

Python Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:

Operator	
=	
+=		
-=		
*=		
/=	
%=		
//=		
**=	
&=	        
|=	
^=	
>>=	
<<=	
:=	

Python Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

Operator	Name	Example	Try it
==	        Equal	x == y	
!=        	Not equal	x != y	
>	        Greater than	x > y	
<	        Less than	x < y	
>=	        Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
<=	        Less than or equal to	x <= y

Python Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:
and
or
not
